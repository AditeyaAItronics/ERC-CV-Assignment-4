##  Computer Vision Based Game

Welcome to our computer vision-based game! In this game, enemy objects are falling from the top of the screen, and the player must use their hand to avoid these objects. The game leverages computer vision technology to track the player's hand movements in real-time.

Features
- Real-time Hand Tracking: Uses computer vision to detect and track hand movements.
- Interactive Gameplay: Avoid falling enemy objects using your hand.

# Virtual Environment Details

I have created a conda environment conda create -n my_conda_env_name python=3.12.4 anaconda and then have installed opencv_python-4.10.0 along with mediapipe-0.10.14 in my conda environment. All coding has been done from my VS code editor
