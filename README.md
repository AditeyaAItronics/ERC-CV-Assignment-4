# Computer Vision Based Game

Welcome to our computer vision-based game! In this game, enemy objects are falling from the top of the screen, and the player must use their hand to avoid these objects. The game leverages computer vision technology to track the player's hand movements in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-time Hand Tracking**: Uses computer vision to detect and track hand movements.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Avoid falling enemy objects using your hand.


## Steps to get you started

- Fork the repo
- clone it on your system
- make the required changes in the python file (main.py)
- push your changes on github
- make a pull request

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/SudhanshuKulkarni24/ERC-CV-Assignment-4
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd ERC-CV-Assignment-4
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

**Problem Statement: Enemy Dodging Game**

A player-controlled object is moved using hand movements. The objective is to dodge falling objects (blocks) that randomly appear on the screen.
The game could rely on OpenCV for hand tracking, and falling objects are randomly generated.


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe
